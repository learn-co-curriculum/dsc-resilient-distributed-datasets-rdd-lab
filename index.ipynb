    "## What Are RDDs ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs) are the core concept in Spark. RDDs can be thought of as __immutable distributed collections of data objects__. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions, which may be computed on different nodes of the cluster. In order to understand how spark works, we should know what RDD’s are and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"split.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Spark RDD is a fault tolerant, distributed collection of data that can be operated in parallel__. With the RDD split into partitions as shown above, spark runs one task for each partition. The Spark RDDs can contain any type of Python, Java or Scala objects, including user-defined classes. \n",
    "\n",
    ">RDDs are not actual data, but they are Objects, which contains information about data residing on the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs try to solve computational problems by enabling fault tolerant, distributed In-memory computations. RDDs have the following properties –\n",
    "\n",
    "__Immutability and partitioning__: RDDs composed of collection of records which are partitioned. Partition is basic unit of parallelism in a RDD, and each partition is one logical division of data which is immutable and created through some transformations on existing partitions.Immutability helps to achieve consistency in computations.Users can define their own criteria for partitioning based on keys on which they want to join multiple datasets if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Coarse grained operations__: Coarse grained operations are operations which are applied to all elements in datasets. For example – a map, or filter or groupBy operation which will be performed on all elements in a partition of RDD.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Fault Tolerance__: Since RDDs are created over a set of transformations , it logs those transformations, rather than actual data.Graph of these transformations to produce one RDD is called as Lineage Graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Resiliance__: RDDs load the data for us and are resilient, which means they can be recomputed when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Lazy evaluated__: The data inside RDD is not available or transformed until an action is executed that triggers the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RDD Transformations vs Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spark, we first create a __base RDD__ and then apply one or more transformations to that base RDD following our processing needs. Being immutable means, **once an RDD is created, it cannot be changed**. As a result, **each transformation on an RDD creates a new RDD**. Finally, we can apply one or more **actions** to the RDDs. Spark uses lazy evaluation, so transformations are not actually executed until an action occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    ">*RDDs perform two types of operations: Transformations, which creates a new dataset from the previous RDD and Actions, which return a value to the driver program after performing the computation on the dataset.*\n",
